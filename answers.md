- **2)**

$W=O(n+m)$, since we only travel across each edge once

- **4)**

Once, since all nodes are reachable if the graph is connected.

- **5)**

$W=O(n+m)$, the same as in question 2, since we call reachable once and there is no increase in work that pushes it to a higher level time compexity.

- **7)**

No, the work would not change. Since, in an adjacency matrix, we can check for neighboring nodes in constant time, the work will still be $W=O(n+m)$
